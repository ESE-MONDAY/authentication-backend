# Authentication Project with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js

This project is a simple authentication system built using MongoDB for data storage and Express.js for handling server-side logic. It provides user registration, login, and logout functionalities.

## Features

- User registration: Users can create an account by providing a unique username and password.
- User login: Registered users can log in using their credentials.
- User logout: Logged-in users can securely log out of their accounts.
- Password hashing: Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database for improved security.
- Session management: User sessions are managed using session cookies for authentication.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing user data.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used for building the server-side logic.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for executing JavaScript code on the server.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ESE-MONDAY/authentication-backend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    cd authentication
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=<mongodb-uri>
    ```

    Replace `<mongodb-uri>` with the URI of your MongoDB database and `<session-secret>` with a random string used for session encryption.

4. Start the server:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Register a new account by providing a unique username and password.
3. Log in using your credentials.
4. Perform authenticated actions such as viewing user-specific content.
5. Log out when you're done.
